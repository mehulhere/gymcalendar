# Product & Technical Specification: Gym Tracking App

## 1) Product Overview

A Next.js (React) Progressive Web App that lets users:

* Check in on a calendar (attendance).
* Log workouts (optionally).
* Build workout plans (days, exercises, sets; optional muscle tagging).
* Track training **volume** and weekly muscle stress.
* Get LLMâ€‘powered insights, alternates, and tips (cached).
* Visualize progressâ€”weights/volume charts, weighâ€‘ins, and "body parts hit" heatmaps.
* Sign up/sign in securely; data stored in MongoDB; JWT auth.

**Primary goal:** Make consistency visible (calendar + heatmaps), keep logging effortless, and use ruleâ€‘based + LLM guidance to steer recovery and progress.

---

## 3) Key Concepts & Definitions

* **Attendance vs. Logging:** Checking in does **not** require logging sets/reps. Logging is optional.
* **Volume (per exercise set):** `load = weight * reps`.
  **Exercise volume:** sum of load across sets.
  **Muscle volume:** sum of exercise volume * muscle weighting (primary = 1.0, secondary = 0.5).
  **Bodyweight/noâ€‘load moves:** use `estimated_load = body_weight * load_factor` (defaults: pushâ€‘up 0.7Ã—BW, pullâ€‘up 1.0Ã—BW, dip 0.9Ã—BW, plank counts as `time_secs / 60 * RPE_weight`, default 20 kg). These factors are configurable.
* **Weekly set count (stress):** Count sets per muscle across a rolling 7â€‘day window.
  **Overreached (red):** > 20 sets/week for a muscle. 10â€“20 = neutral, <10 = low (blue scale).
* **Makeâ€‘up session:** Doing 2 sessions on one day allows allocating one session to a **past missed scheduled day in the same calendar week**. That missed day becomes "made up" (green outlined with âœ“ icon).

---

## 4) User Roles

* **User:** CRUD on own data
* **Admin (optional):** Manage exercise dictionary; moderate reports; view analytics

---

## 5) User Stories (selected)

1. As a user I can sign up/sign in securely and stay signed in.
2. I can tap a date to **check in**; attended dates turn **green**; missed scheduled days are **red**; rest/unscheduled days are **gray**.
3. I can allocate a second workout on a day as a **makeâ€‘up** for a prior missed day (same week).
4. I can build workout plans: create days (e.g., "Leg Day" or "Day 1"), add exercises, sets, reps; optionally tag muscle groups or autoâ€‘infer from exercise name.
5. I can start a workout from a plan: see exercise cards, mark sets done, mark exercise done (card turns green).
6. For each exercise, I can tap a **YouTube icon** to open results in the YouTube app or browser.
7. I can add alternates to an exercise; if none exist, tap a **Remix** button to fetch alternates from the LLM (cached).
8. I can tap a **Tips (ðŸ’¡)** icon to get LLM tips for that exercise/session (cached).
9. I can log weights/reps; see volume and weight charts over time.
10. I can record weighâ€‘ins and a goal (target weight + target date) and see "on track?" feedback.
11. I can open a **Stats** page showing today's hit muscles, weekly heatmap, muscles over 20 sets (red), and weighâ€‘in charts.

### 6.3 Workout Plan Builder

* Create Plan â†’ Add "Days" (name + recurrence: by weekday(s) or "Day 1/2/3 loop")
* Add Exercises to a day: name (autocomplete from dictionary with large touch targets), sets (count), default reps, optional target weight, **muscles** (autoâ€‘infer via dictionary; user can override)
* **Alternates**: add multiple manually via bottom sheet; also "Suggest alternates" (LLM)
* Exercise row has **YouTube** icon (opens YouTube app or in-app browser)
* Floating Action Button (FAB) to save as draft or publish (active)
* Only one active plan at a time (configurable)

## 8) Exercise Dictionary (seed & usage)

* **Fields:** `name`, `aliases[]`, `equipment` (machine, cable, dumbbell, barbell, bodyweight, band), `primary_muscles[]`, `secondary_muscles[]`, `category` (push, pull, hinge, squat, carry, core), `youtube_query_override` (optional)
* Used for autocomplete; muscle inference; default YouTube search; LLM grounding (provide dictionary to prompt for alternates/tips)
* Seed at least 300 common movements across machines/free weights/bodyweight

---

## 9) Data Model (MongoDB collections)

**users**

* `_id`, `email` (unique), `password_hash`, `name`, `settings` { `unit`: 'kg'|'lb', `timezone`, `equipment[]`, `theme`: 'light'|'dark'|'system' }, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`

**auth_tokens** (optional if using rotating refresh tokens)

* `userId`, `refreshTokenHash`, `expiresAt`, `createdAt`

**exercises**

* `_id`, `name`, `aliases[]`, `equipment`, `primary_muscles[]`, `secondary_muscles[]`, `category`, `youtube_query_override`, `createdBy` (null for system)

**plans**

  * `weekdayMap`: `{mon: planDayId|null, ...}` (if weekday mode)
  * `sequenceOrder[]`: `[planDayId]` (if Day 1/2/3 loop)
* `days[]`: `[ { _id, name, notes, exercises:[{ exerciseId, sets, defaultReps, targetWeight, musclesOverride{primary[],secondary[]} , alternates[exerciseId] }] } ]`
* timestamps

---

## 10) Core Algorithms & Business Rules

### 10.1 Attendance & Makeâ€‘Ups

1. **Scheduled day detection**
   * If `schedule.mode = weekday`, a given date is scheduled if `weekdayMap` has a plan day
   * If `sequence`, generate schedule across weeks by rolling through `sequenceOrder` and skipping days without planned training (e.g., every other day)

2. **Marking missed**
   * At midnight local or on calendar render: if date < today and scheduled but no checkâ€‘in nor makeâ€‘up allocation â†’ `missed`

3. **Double session (makeâ€‘up)**
   * When finishing a second session today, show bottom sheet listing **missed scheduled days this week (Monâ€“Sun) with no existing makeâ€‘up**
   * On select, set `session.makeupForDate = <missedDate>` and update that `attendance` to `attended` with flag `madeUpBySessionId`

### 10.2 Volume

```
setVolume = weight * reps
exerciseVolume = Î£ setVolume
muscleVolume = Î£ (exerciseVolume * weightFactor)
where weightFactor = 1.0 (primary) or 0.5 (secondary)
sessionVolume = Î£ exerciseVolume
weeklyMuscleSets = Î£ sets per muscle in last 7 days
```

### 10.3 Muscle Heatmaps

* **Blue scale** for intensity (low â†’ high) based on normalized **muscleVolume** (or sets) in the selected window
* **Red outline/fill** if `weeklyMuscleSets > 20`

### 10.4 Weighâ€‘in "On Track?" Rule

* Let `W0` = latest 7â€‘day avg weight, `Wg` = goal weight, `D` = days until target date
* **Required daily rate:** `r_req = (W0 - Wg) / D` (kg/day; negative if gaining)
* **Actual rate (trend):** linear regression slope of last 14â€“21 days of 7â€‘day average
* **Status:**
  * `|r_act| >= 0.9 * |r_req|` and same sign â†’ **On track**
  * `0.5 * |r_req| <= |r_act| < 0.9 * |r_req|` â†’ **Slightly behind**
  * `|r_act| < 0.5 * |r_req|` â†’ **Behind**
  * `|r_act| > 1.5 * |r_req|` â†’ **Aggressive (monitor recovery)**
* Display guidance & safety note (not medical advice)

### 10.5 LLM Prompts (summaries)

* **Alternates:** "Suggest 3 alternates for `<exercise>` targeting `<primary_muscles>` with equipment: `<user.equipment[]>`. Return JSON with `name, reason, equipment`."
* **Tips:** "Provide 3 concise coaching cues and 2 safety tips for `<exercise>`. Keep each under 20 words."
* **Insights:** "Analyze weekly muscle volume trends for `<user>`: list muscles trending down 2 consecutive weeks or >20 sets/week. Output 4â€“6 advice bullets; encourage recovery focus when applicable."

Each response stored in `llm_cache` keyed by `(type, exerciseId/period/userId, modelVersion)` with TTL (e.g., 30â€“90 days).
